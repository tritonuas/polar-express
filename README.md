Welcome to TUAS Software Team!

This repo (hopefully) contains all knowledge necessary to get you up and
running. There are a series of scripts and bash tweaks to ease set up of your
development environment. Running ./setup.sh should do everything you need.

Check out the Wiki for more info.

Why is this called the Polar Express? In the *Polar Express* a young boy learns
that in order to hear the magic he simply needed to believe. Thus, for us to
succeed in everything we do we must believe that we can!
